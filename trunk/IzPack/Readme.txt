New Feature:
Zug3.0 version now can call the external java jar files as builtin atoms through chur spreadsheet. To make it happen the ZugINI.xml parsing is need. Inside the Zug installation directory the ZugINI.xml file can be edited to by putting the values in the tags of 
<inprocesspackages>
	  <inprocesspackage name="" language="">
	      <file-path></file-path>
	      <jar-package></jar-package>
	      <class-name></class-name>
	</inprocesspackage>
</inprocesspackages>
if no value is written then it will show a warning message while running the ZUG automation.
this xml configuration is in ZUG installation folder. ZugINI.xml

Example:
<inprocesspackages>
	  <inprocesspackage name="Zbrowser" language="java">
	      <file-path>C:\Programfiles\Automature\ZUOZ\Inprocess</file-path>
	      <jar-package>com.automature.zuoz.inprocess.zbrowser</jar-package>
	      <class-name>BrowserOperations</class-name>
	</inprocesspackage>             
</inprocesspackages>

Zug Dependencies:
  
  • Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment(32bit) 1.6 (update 21). Zug only runs in 32bit version of Java Runtime Enviorment. It dont support the 64bit JRE.
  
  • To work with In-process atoms in Chur. ZugINI.xml must be configured. The xml tags.
      
      <inprocesspackage name="">
	      <file-path></file-path>
	      <jar-package></jar-package>
	      <class-name></class-name>
	    </inprocesspackage>
	
	under root//inprocesspackages tag. In the builtinpackage attribute 'name', provide the namespace with which the In-process atoms will be called.
  
  file-path: The direcrtoty path(fully qualified) of the jar file and the lib files necessary for it.
  jar-package: The package architecture of the class file where the in process atoms are written as methods.
  class-name: The class name of the java class file where the methods are defined for automation. In Chur they are called atoms with the namespaces.

 remove if only if you installed Zuoz3.0 or above after Zug installation other wise you ignore this message, It will run the testcases containg external atoms.
   
  •  sqlitejdbc-v056.jar file needed to be copied to current JRE lib/ext folder as it is installed. like - C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\lib\ext
     Now the installer copies this file to the specific location. If due to any permission reason it fails please copy it manually.
