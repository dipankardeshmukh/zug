# zug
An interpreter and IDE for developing and executing automated test scripts written in the CHUR language

Zug. now renamed to SPARK, is Automatureâ€™s software test automation tool. SPARK provides an execution environment for tests specified using a high level test specification language namely CHUR. Zug is platform independent, and can be used on any environment that supports the Java Runtime Environment.

The CHUR test specification language is organized as a spreadsheet, and can be thought of as a powerful scripting language, but very focussed on testing functionality. Coupled with the use of atom liraries, it can be used to test any system in any domain. Spark is also integrated with Zermatt, a web-based test management and reporting framework, that resides in the cloud (private or public).

BASEL is a testcase generation tool for CHUR, that specializes in click-n-create type of automated testsuite creation for complex web applications. Testsuites created with BASEL can be executed using the SPARK execution environment.

There is a rich collection of documentation and tutorials under the Documentation folder. To install Spark, visit  ftp://trial:trialVersionOnly@attic.automature.com:33621/SPARK/ to download the latest installer. SPARK is supported on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

To take advantage of the out-of-the-box rich set of atoms, you will need to install Zuoz.
